## Boring Gallery app :-)

This holds a pretty good idea of what I did to install bootstrap on RoR using webpack :)
[https://dev.to/vvo/a-rails-6-setup-guide-for-2019-and-2020-hf5](https://dev.to/vvo/a-rails-6-setup-guide-for-2019-and-2020-hf5)

Now, to be really clear with the ActionView talk let's summarize the key points for the talk.

## Instalation

First of all, let's install everything to be able to use the project, we will need nothing fancy, regular rails commands.

run `$ rvm list` to make sure your in vesion `ruby-2.7.2`

then `$ nvm list` to make sure the selected NodeJS version is `v15.2.0`

if none of this are your current versions please, install the correct versions ðŸ™Œ

if you need help drom a question in the bootcamp channel

Let's install dependencies `$ bundle install`

Let's run `$ rails db:migrate` to create the db

and now!! let's find some pics to fill some galleries ðŸŽ‰ !!!

and let's create a couple of galleries, will need the app running for that ðŸ˜…

let's run `$ rails s` and fill some cool galleries ðŸ˜Ž use the app a bit, the navigation will help you understand how it works

## Templates

the main folder to store the templates is [https://github.com/aradiquez/ImageGallery/tree/master/app/views](app/views) this is where rails engine looks for our view.

### ERB

Layouts: [https://github.com/aradiquez/ImageGallery/tree/master/app/views/layouts](app/views/layouts) the main file is `application.html/erb` this is the layout by default, this is the frame for the all the application, and provides the flexibility to inject templates for our actions.

contents: [https://github.com/aradiquez/ImageGallery/blob/master/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb#L15](yield) this is a section is defined to inyect our templates using that space in the main page of the app.

how can the app injects a template there? [https://github.com/aradiquez/ImageGallery/blob/master/app/views/galleries/index.html.erb#L1](content_for) this is the block method that help us inyect a template we define in any action view into the layout.

We have a common CRUD structure, generated by scaffold, the interesting part is inside each file.

- galleries: [https://github.com/aradiquez/ImageGallery/tree/master/app/views/galleries](app/views/galleries)
- pictures: [https://github.com/aradiquez/ImageGallery/tree/master/app/views/pictures](app/views/pictures)

this one is a bit more interesting **shared:** [https://github.com/aradiquez/ImageGallery/tree/master/app/views/shared](app/views/shared) we have 3 files in the directory.

- `_jumbotron.html.erb` is the header, where the buttons helper to create `Add New {XXXX}` and the Home buton. [https://github.com/aradiquez/ImageGallery/blob/master/app/views/shared/_jumbotron.html.erb#L9-L10]{link_to} this is the default link helper from rails code helper, and also where we use some `locals` variables sent as a param to this partial! [https://github.com/aradiquez/ImageGallery/blob/master/app/views/shared/_jumbotron.html.erb#L4-L6](title and subtitle)
